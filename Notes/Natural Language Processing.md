# Natural Language Processing

## Output
We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen
We use whats called the `print()` function to display output

``python
print("Your text goes in here.")
``
## [[Headers]]

# Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are not interpreted by Python.
This means that the text is ignored.
We use the # symbol to make comments
```
# This is a comment
```
# Input 
We can grab information from the user using input() . 
When we run the function, in does two things:
1. It waits for the user to write something or nothing
2. The user presses Enter/Return button of indicate that they're finished
```python
input()

input(prompt) #
```

# Variables
Variables allow us to store information for the time that our app is running

~~~python
favourite_food = input("What is your favourite food? ")
~~~
favourite_food = name of the variable
= -> assignment operator
input... -> value

# Naming

What you can do:
1. name them with letters, numbers, underscores
2. name should start with a lowercase letter 
What you cant do:
1. you can't name them with spaces or symbols
2. you cant name them with certain names that are reserved
	1.  e.g. if, while, for, and, or, ....

A good name is something like this.
~~~python
favourite_food
fave_food 
date_of_birth
student_number
~~~

Bad names are like this:
~~~python
Favourite_food
a
num
aa
aaa
~~~
