We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen
We use whats called the `print()` function to display output

``python
print("Your text goes in here.")

Comments are pieces of text that are not interpreted by Python.
This means that the text is ignored.
We use the # symbol to make comments

# This is a comment
```
