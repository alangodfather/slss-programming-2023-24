A list in Python is a collection of items
We can store different values in a list
Order matters in a list
# Creating a List
To make a list, we use brackets [ ] to surround our list
We separate out the item using ,

```python
some_list = ["John, Tim, Sarah"]
```

# Access Elements in a list
We can grab things from lists using the brackets notation
In our example above, if i wanted to access "TIm" , I would do the following

```python
some_list[1] #gives us Tim
some_list[2] #gives us Sarah
some_list[-1] #gives us Sarah
some_list[-2] #gives us Tim
```

Inside the brackets we say the index of the value we get
Python uses "0-index" counting. which means we start counting at 0
