Modules are bits of code that we can use in Python
These bits of code aren't automatically included, so we need to import them into our code

# Import
The import keyword loads the module into our file
imports should be at the top of the file under the header
# The time Module
Time allows us to play around with anything related to time
We can pause our code using time

```python
import time


```
