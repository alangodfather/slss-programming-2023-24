We create headings in Markdown using hash (#) symbols
TO create subheadings, we use multiple has symbols

## This is a level 2 subheading

### This is a level 3 subheading
###### This is a level 6 subheading

# Modifying Text Style
We use asterisks (\*) to modify text styling, specifically 
bold and italics
e.g.
I want this ***word** specifically to be bold
I want this word* to be italicized
I want this word to be both bold and italicized

**Aside**: If we want to place a character that is a keyword or a reserved word, and we want the LITERAL character, us the forward slash (\\)
	e.g. if we want to put an asterisk, we do this \\\*
## Strikethrough
We can. also strike through characters using the tilde (~)
I want to strikethrough this specific ~~word~~
~~This sentence is struck through~~

# Links
We can link things in our Markdown files
[One tool to use](https://chat.openai.com)
Exercise:
- ask ChatGPT to create for you markdown code that is a link to two websites of your choice
- if you don't have ChatGPT/openai, create two links to website of your choice in the space below

e.g.
[Lebron](https://www.instagram.com/kingjames/?hl=en)
[Lakers](https://twitter.com/Lakers?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)

# Blockquotes
blockquotes allow us to emphasize a bigger chuck of text
We use carets (>) to create blockquotes

> This is an example of a blockquote
> This is line two of the blockquote
> 
> This is the fourth line, the third is blank

# Lists
We can create both unordered and ordered lists

# Unordered Lists
To create each point, we use (\*) with a space behind it
We can create sublists by placing TABS before the asterisks 
e.g.
* dairy
	* egg
	* milk
	* cheese
* juice

# Ordered Lists
If there is a specific order to the elements in our list
we create ordered lists
We use numbers, followed by periods to create ordered lists

e.g.
1. Put butter into mixing bowl
2. Add sugar to the butter
   Add both brown and regular sugar
3. Use the mixer to cream the butter

# Tables
We can organize information in tables using Markdown
We use dashes (-) and pipes (|)

Tables in Markdown requires headings

e.g.

| Name        | Age        | Sign        | Superpower      |
| ---         | ---        | ---         | ---             |
| Bruce Wayne | 35         | Aquarius    | Intelligence/ $ |
| Mr. Ubial   | Unaging    | All of them | Dad strength    |
| Yourself    | Your age   | Your Sign   | Super strength  |
